# Unoptimized Code


# Optimized Code

The number of variables used has been reduced drastically as the
code is an optimized one.
The load and store operations have been done in single statements
and there is a lesser use of jump statements
All strings inside printf() and scanf() are declared at the beginning of
the code.
In order to compensate for the optimum usage of base registers the
optimized code has more lines of code than the optimized one
